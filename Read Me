Game 2048 is one of a popular game and this projects some what gives a glipmse of the whole game.
I tried to make algorithm as sharp as possible covering up the edge cases as well.
Basic Discciption of the game is given below.
  2048 game is a addition game where two same numbers adds up when in the same column or row. Your final outcome is to make 2048 from 
  2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 ..... 2048
  Keylistner is used to manipulate this game. 
  Up-Arrow - To sum and slide all the element to the top row wise.
  Down-Arrow - To sum and slide all the element to the bottom row wise.
  Right-Arrow - To sum and slide all the element to the right column wise.
  Left-Arrow - To sum and slide all the element to the left column wise.
I also added a undo function so that an mispress can be handled.
  Back-Space - To get the previous board of the game.
